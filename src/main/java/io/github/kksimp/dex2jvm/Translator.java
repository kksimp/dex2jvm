// Translator -- the Dalvik-to-JVM translation pass: the seam between the DEX
// side (DexFile / InstructionDecoder / TypeInference) and the class-file side
// (ClassFileWriter / CodeWriter / StackMapWriter).
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE PROBLEM
// Dalvik is a REGISTER machine: every instruction names its operands and its
// destination. The JVM is a STACK machine: operands are pushed, the op consumes
// them, the result is stored. So each Dalvik instruction becomes a short,
// stack-neutral JVM sequence:
//
//     push each operand from its local  ->  emit the JVM op  ->  store the result
//
// "Stack-neutral" is load-bearing. Because every Dalvik instruction begins and
// ends with an empty JVM operand stack, a StackMapTable frame at any DEX
// instruction boundary has an empty stack, and the only interesting part of the
// frame is the locals array. That is what makes frame emission tractable here
// (see frameAt below); an exception handler is the single exception, entering
// with exactly the thrown object on the stack.
//
// THE REGISTER-TO-LOCAL MAPPING (the part that is not obvious)
// A Dalvik register is UNTYPED: v3 may hold an int here and an object there,
// and `const v3, 0` produces a value that is legally an int, a float, AND a
// null reference until something consumes it. The JVM verifier will not accept
// that: a local has one type at each point, and `istore` followed by `aload` of
// the same slot is a verify error.
//
// So the mapping is not register -> slot but (REGISTER, SCALAR) -> SLOT. v3
// read as an int and v3 read as a reference are two different JVM locals.
// TypeInference has already done the hard half: it hands back, per instruction,
// a Use[] whose entries are resolved to ONE scalar each, and a Def[] whose
// `scalars` may carry several bits, meaning "materialise this value in each of
// these representations". A `const v3, 0` therefore stores three times: into
// v3's int slot, its float slot, and its object slot. That costs a few bytes of
// bytecode and buys verifiability.
//
// Parameters are handled separately because the JVM dictates their slots: on
// entry locals 0..argSlots-1 ARE the arguments, in order, with `this` at 0.
// Dalvik instead puts parameters in the LAST registers. A prologue copies each
// incoming parameter into the register slot(s) the body expects, after which
// the parameter slots are never written again -- which is what lets frameAt
// report them from the descriptor instead of tracking them.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
// Class-level assembly (fields, the constant pool, attributes) is DexConverter's
// job; this class only fills in one method's Code attribute.

     * DEX2JVM_NARROW_TRY -- cover only the THROWING instructions of a DEX try
     * range in the JVM exception table (default ON; =0 restores the previous
     * output byte for byte: one exception_table row per catch spanning the whole
     * DEX range, frames computed under the JVM edge rule).
     *
     * THE MISMATCH THIS REMOVES. A DEX try_item names a contiguous range, but
     * ART routes an exception to its handler only from an instruction that can
     * actually throw: the catch lookup is keyed on the dex_pc of the throwing
     * instruction, and ART's verifier gives a handler edge only to instructions
     * flagged kThrow (art/libdexfile/dex/dex_instruction_list.h; our
     * Opcodes.canThrow and TypeInference.canThrow are that exact 84-opcode set,
     * checked mechanically on 2026-09-26). JVMS 4.10.1.6 instead applies
     * instructionSatisfiesHandlers to EVERY instruction whose offset lies in an
     * exception_table row, throwing or not, and HotSpot implements exactly that
     * (verifier.cpp verify_exception_handler_targets: `if (bci >= start_pc &&
     * bci < end_pc)`). Copying the DEX range verbatim therefore made the handler
     * frame answer for program points ART never connects to it, and some of
     * those points hold a slot the verifier types `top` -- a register reused
     * after an uninitialized `new` merged into it, or the handler's own
     * `move-object`s when R8 places a handler inside the range it guards. The
     * handler frame then had to say `top`, and the handler body, which reads the
     * register because ART proved it is a reference on every THROWING path,
     * failed the split verifier:
     *
     *   org/joinmastodon/android/api/f.run()V @2402: aload
     *   Type top (current frame, locals[18]) is not assignable to reference type
     *
     * That shape was the largest G8 family left (24 of 62 split-verifier
     * errors across the 62-app corpus, 2026-09-26), plus the protected-receiver
     * failures whose receiver had been widened the same way (kotlinx
     * SharedFlowImpl.collect$suspendImpl).
     *
     * THE FIX. Emit one row per maximal run of reachable throwing instructions
     * inside the DEX range, and analyse under the ART edge rule. The set of
     * program points that can reach a handler is then IDENTICAL on both sides,
     * which is also the most faithful reading of the DEX: a non-throwing
     * instruction cannot raise anything on ART, and its JVM expansion (loads,
     * stores, gotos, arithmetic that cannot trap) cannot raise anything on the
     * JVM either. Rows only multiply where a range interleaves throwing and
     * non-throwing code. Measured cost over the 62-app corpus: +0.31% jar
     * bytes as first landed (max +1.44% on one app), +0.24% with
     * MONITOR_SAFE_TRY, all of it in exception_table rows. The one exception
     * is a catch-all clause in a method that takes a monitor, which HotSpot's
     * JIT needs whole; see MONITOR_SAFE_TRY.
     *
     * Read once, at class initialisation: a JVM's environment is fixed for its
     * lifetime. NOTE a cache of converted output that is keyed on the
     * converter's code identity rather than on this flag has to be cleared
     * between the arms of an A/B comparison.

     * narrows catch-all clauses in those methods too, the NARROW_TRY output as
     * first landed; irrelevant when NARROW_TRY=0, which is whole-range anyway).
     *
     * WHAT NARROWING BROKE, AND WHY NO VERIFIER SAW IT. C1 and C2 compile a
     * method with monitorenter only if GenerateOopMap proves its monitors
     * balanced (ciMethod::has_balanced_monitors, run as GeneratePairingInfo).
     * Its exception rule (generateOopMap.cpp do_exception_edge, jdk21u) takes
     * every bytecode that Bytecodes::can_trap -- and bytecodes.cpp marks ldc,
     * ldc_w, ldc2_w and checkcast can_trap along with the obvious ones -- walks
     * the exception_table rows covering it, stops at the first catch_type 0 row,
     * and if there is none while a lock is held, sets _monitor_safe = false
     * ("non-empty monitor stack at exceptional exit"). The compile is then
     * skipped at every tier ("not compilable (unbalanced monitors)") and the
     * method stays interpreted for the life of the process.
     *
     * The emitter produces exactly those bytecodes for NON-throwing DEX
     * instructions: `ldc` for a `const`/`const-wide` or float literal that no
     * short form encodes, `checkcast` where a use needs a narrower type than
     * the frame proves. D8's catch-all around a synchronized body covered them,
     * and NARROW_TRY dropped them from it on purpose, so the output still ran
     * and verified while the JIT gave up on the method. Measured with
     * a standalone replica of that rule (CodeWriter.monitorImbalance is the
     * in-converter copy), methods that cannot be compiled across the 62-app
     * corpus: 8,915 -> 31,477 of 107,848 with a monitor (mastodon 16 -> 73 of
     * 188); with this flag, 8,915 again, the SAME methods in every app, with G8
     * unchanged. With this flag off, HotSpot itself logs "Monitor mismatch" and
     * "COMPILE SKIPPED ... (unbalanced monitors)" for such a method.
     *
     * THE FIX. Only catch_type 0 rows count to that rule, and typed rows do
     * not, so only the catch-all needs the whole range back. Typed catches stay
     * narrowed -- that is where the handler-reads-`top` G8 family lives -- and
     * the catch-all handler's frame is computed from every instruction in its
     * range (TypeInference.MethodInput.catchAllWideEdges), which is the JVM rule
     * HotSpot's verifier applies to that row. Keyed on the METHOD because a
     * nested try/finally inside a synchronized block needs its own catch-all
     * whole too, and GenerateOopMap's verdict is per method anyway.
     *
     * If that wider catch-all frame leaves a register a catch-all handler reads
     * undefined (the old wide-rule failure), the method falls back to the full
     * narrow output: convertible and verifiable beats compilable.

     *  This is deliberately a LOUD stub. MethodOutliner's header argues against
     *  silent stubs and is right; a body that names its own limit in the

     * DEX2JVM_MONITOR_COVER -- give a monitor method that HotSpot's JIT

     * because it is a refinement of the table those two produce).
     *
     * WHAT IT FIXES. Measured with a standalone replica of that rule over
     * the 62-app corpus (2026-09-26): 8,915 of 107,848 methods with a monitor
     * (8.3%; nowinandroid 1,427 of 2,691) that C1 and C2 refuse with "not
     * compilable (unbalanced monitors)", so they run interpreted forever. By
     * reason: 8,231 "non-empty monitor stack at exceptional exit" (7,927 of them
     * at an ldc: a DEX const that d8 left outside every try range inside the
     * lock), 667 "merge conflict" and 17 "underflow" (non-throwing instructions
     * AFTER a monitor-exit that d8 merged into the range whose catch-all
     * releases the lock, so the whole-range catch-all row fed depth 0 into a
     * handler entered at depth 1). See MonitorCover for the mechanism and the
     * argument that no row it adds or removes can route a real exception.
     * Result on the same corpus: 8,915 -> 98 (the floor is itemised in
     * MonitorCover's header); HotSpot compiled 8,796 of the 8,817 rescued
     * methods at tier 4 and refused none (21 need ad-SDK classes the harness
     * cannot load); jar bytes +0.0053%; G6/G7 pass on all 62 apps and every
     * changed class still verifies.
     *
     * HOW IT IS APPLIED, and why output only changes where it helps. The
     * method is translated as before; only if that output fails
     * CodeWriter.monitorImbalance (a replica of GenerateOopMap's monitor rule)
     * is MonitorCover asked for a plan. The method is then translated again
     * from the SAME inputs, so its body, frames and handlers are identical, and
     * only the exception table changes: non-throwing instructions leave a
     * catch-all row entered in another monitor context, and lock-holding
     * non-throwing instructions nothing of their context covers (plus, under
     * MONITOR_COVER_THROWING, throwing ones outside every try) get a row to a
     * release stub appended after the body (emitCoverStubs). The result is kept
     * only if the replica then PASSES. A refused plan, a re-translation that
     * throws, or one that is still unbalanced puts the original writer back
     * untouched. So every method this changes goes from uncompilable to
     * compilable by the replica, and every other method is byte-identical --
     * except that a class holding a reverted attempt may carry the constant
     * pool entries that attempt added, which no code references.
     *
     * The replica does not track lock identity, so "compilable" is confirmed by
     * HotSpot itself (a WhiteBox compile of the rescued methods at tier 4,
     * with MONITOR_COVER=0 as the control that must be refused).
     * DEX2JVM_MONITOR_COVER_DEBUG=1 prints one line per attempted method (rescued / refused / reverted, with the reason).

         * ART and the JVM disagree about exception edges. ART only routes a
         * handler edge from an instruction that can THROW, so DEX code may
         * legally write a register with a non-throwing `const` inside a try and
         * read it in the handler -- on any real path the write happened first.
         * JVMS 4.10.1.6 applies instructionSatisfiesHandlers to EVERY
         * instruction in the protected range, throwing or not, so to the JVM
         * that same local is `top` on entry to the handler:
         *
         *   Type top (current frame, locals[5]) is not assignable to
         *   'android/app/Activity' (stack map, locals[5])
         *
         * Definite assignment here makes the JVM's conservative merge agree
         * with ART's precise one: the pre-range value is a zero/null rather
         * than `top`, and null merges with any reference to that reference
         * (JVMS 4.10.1.2), so the handler frame keeps its type.
         *
         * The alternative -- adding handler edges from every instruction so our
         * own analysis matches the JVM's -- was measured and reverted: it makes
         * registers dead at handlers that the handler genuinely reads, and
         * costs 5-11 classes per app to "no local for vN scalar none". Making
         * the claim TRUE beats weakening it.
         *
         * Runs before the parameter copies, which overwrite the slots they own.

         *      monitor context from the handler -- so it becomes the runs

         *      emitTryCatch's, in emitTryCatch's order.
         *   2. Lock-holding instructions the plan assigns a stub -- non-throwing
         *      ones no row of their context covers, and (MONITOR_COVER_THROWING)
         *      throwing ones outside every try range -- get rows of their own,
         *      appended in code order, one per maximal run with the same stub.
         *      Appending is safe for first-match dispatch: under narrowing no
         *      typed row covers a non-throwing instruction, no row at all covers
         *      an instruction outside every try, and the plan only assigns a
         *      stub where no catch-all row (after change 1) does, so each
         *      appended row is the only row at its bci.
         *
         * Dropping a row over an instruction never invalidates a handler's
         * frame (it was computed from a superset of predecessors), and a stub's
         * frame is TOP but for the lock slots (frameFor), so the analysis is
         * the base translation's, unchanged. The whole-range fallback
         * emitTryCatch takes when narrowed rows would overflow the u2 table
         * length is not reproduced: such a method is refused and keeps its
         * previous output, as is one whose table this would overflow.
