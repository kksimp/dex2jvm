//
// Each field is seeded, highest precedence first, from a system property, an
// environment variable, an optional HostDefaults class, then the built-in
// default:
//
//   field            system property            environment variable        HostDefaults field
//   syntheticPrefix  dex2jvm.syntheticPrefix    DEX2JVM_SYNTHETIC_PREFIX    SYNTHETIC_PREFIX

//   exitRedirect     dex2jvm.redirectExit       DEX2JVM_REDIRECT_EXIT       REDIRECT_EXIT
//   threads          dex2jvm.threads            DEX2JVM_THREADS             THREADS
//   logTag           dex2jvm.logTag             DEX2JVM_LOG_TAG             LOG_TAG
//   parsedMarker     dex2jvm.parsedMarker       DEX2JVM_PARSED_MARKER       PARSED_MARKER

// HOSTDEFAULTS. A product that vendors this source tree can add a class named
// HostDefaults to THIS package, holding public static final String fields named
// as in the last column. Its values become that build's defaults, so the
// vendored copy can be synced from upstream verbatim and still behave the way
// the product needs: the product's own settings live in one file the sync
// never touches. A build without the class (this repository) uses the built-in
// defaults.
