/**
 * The converter's one table of app call sites that can be redirected to a
 * host-supplied class. Both families are OPT-IN and OFF by default.
 *
 * A re-point swaps the method reference of an invoke for a static on the
 * configured class, with the receiver (if any) prepended to the descriptor. The
 * operand stack the DEX proto describes is untouched, so frames, registers and
 * the move-result that follows are unaffected. Two families live here:
 *
 * 1. sun.misc.Unsafe accessors -> Options.unsafeRedirect, same name, receiver
 *    prepended (see {@link UnsafeRepoint} for the table and for why code that
 *    walks ART's object layout through Unsafe needs it on HotSpot).
 *
 * 2. Process exit -> Options.exitRedirect:
 *      System.exit(int)   [invoke-static]   -> systemExit(I)V
 *      Runtime.exit(int)  [invoke-virtual]  -> runtimeExit(Ljava/lang/Runtime;I)V
 *      Runtime.halt(int)  [invoke-virtual]  -> runtimeHalt(Ljava/lang/Runtime;I)V
 *    WHY. On a device these end the process by SIGKILL-equivalent means and
 *    the ActivityManager relaunches it if an activity start is pending -- the
 *    basis of every "restart myself" idiom (JakeWharton's ProcessPhoenix is the
 *    one Aurora Store and NewPipe ship). On HotSpot the same calls end the
 *    WHOLE VM: Runtime.exit runs shutdown hooks, then vm_exit and libc exit(),
 *    whose atexit handlers and C++ static destructors run while the VM is
 *    going down -- and a native destructor that re-enters JNI at that point
 *    blocks forever in JavaThread::block_if_vm_exited, so the "exit" can hang
 *    instead. A host that runs the converted app inside a JVM it owns routes
 *    these calls to its own class, which can then play the ActivityManager's
 *    part (relaunch on a pending start, or end only the app). Kotlin's
 *    exitProcess() inlines to System.exit, so it is covered.
 *
 * Only the input dex is ever routed: the converter never sees framework or
 * library classes that are not in it.
