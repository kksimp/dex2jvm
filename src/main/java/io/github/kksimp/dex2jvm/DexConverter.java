// DexConverter -- the public entry point of the DEX -> JVM bytecode converter,
// a Java reimplementation of what the Python enjarify does.
//
// Two shapes of caller, deliberately:
//
//   convert(dex)                 the bulk path: every class at once, which is
//                                what building a whole classes.jar needs.
//   convertClass(dex, name)      the lazy path: ONE class, translated when a
//                                class loader's findClass asks for it. Most of an
//                                app's classes are never loaded (measured 54% of
//                                Calculator, 85% of GD Lite wasted), so the
//                                on-demand path skips that work entirely.
//   open(dex...)                 the efficient lazy path: parse once, keep the
//                                DexFile resident, answer many class requests.
//                                convertClass re-parses per call, which is fine
//                                for a one-off but wasteful in a loop.
//
// ERROR POLICY: one bad method must not lose its class, and one bad class must
// not lose the APK. enjarify made the same choice (main.py collects per-class
// errors and keeps going) and it is what lets an app load when a single
// unusual method fails to translate: the class still loads, and the failure
// only surfaces if that method is actually called. Failures are recorded in
// errors() rather than thrown.

    /**
     * Synthesizes {@code @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)} on an annotation
     * TYPE declaration that does not already carry a runtime-visible one.
     *
     * WHY. On Android, runtime visibility is a PER-USE byte in the DEX
     * (annotation_item.visibility: VISIBILITY_RUNTIME 0x01 "visible at
     * runtime"), and ART's reflection reads only that byte -- every getter in
     * art/runtime/dex/dex_file_annotations.cc passes kDexVisibilityRuntime and
     * GetAnnotationItemFromAnnotationSet skips items failing
     * IsVisibilityCompatible(annotation_item->visibility_, visibility); the
     * word "Retention" does not appear in that file. So to ART the type-level
     * {@code @Retention} is dead metadata, and R8 strips it (measured: TikTok
     * 46.4.3 has ZERO occurrences of Ljava/lang/annotation/Retention; across
     * all 37 dex files, while its settings interfaces carry runtime-visible
     * annotation uses).
     *
     * HotSpot derives visibility the OTHER way round, from the type:
     * sun.reflect.annotation.AnnotationType defaults a missing
     * {@code @Retention} to RetentionPolicy.CLASS, and
     * AnnotationParser.parseAnnotations2 then drops every parsed use whose
     * type is not RUNTIME-retained -- getAnnotation() returns null with no
     * error. Stamping the type RUNTIME makes that filter a no-op, which
     * leaves the per-use visibility (already split into RuntimeVisible /
     * RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations by addAnnotationAttributes) as the sole
     * authority -- exactly ART's model.
     *
     * The stamp is UNCONDITIONAL for retention-less types, not driven by
     * whether some use site in the session is runtime-visible, because it
     * cannot over-expose: a VISIBILITY_BUILD use lands in
     * RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations, which HotSpot's ClassFileParser DISCARDS at
     * class load unless -XX:+PreserveAllAnnotations (default false), and
     * JVMS 4.7.17 says such annotations "are not made available by the class
     * libraries". Evidence-driven stamping would also
     * need a session-wide use-site scan, i.e. cross-class state on the
     * per-class fan-out, for no behavioural difference.
     *
     * The other meta-annotations R8 strips need NO counterpart on purpose:
     * ART consults {@code @Inherited} and {@code @Repeatable} from the DEX at
     * runtime (libcore Class.getAnnotation walks superclasses only "if
     * (annotationClass.isDeclaredAnnotationPresent(Inherited.class))"), so
     * when R8 removes them the DEVICE loses the behaviour too and absence is
     * parity; {@code @Target} and {@code @Documented} have no reflective
     * effect beyond being queryable, and null matches the device. Synthesizing
     * any of them would invent behaviour ART does not have.
     *
     * A type carrying an EXPLICIT runtime-visible {@code @Retention} (R8 kept
     * it, or the app is unminified) is left alone.
